We are working with Lending Club (LC), an online peer-to-peer lending platform.

Our goal is to create a model that helps the company determine the probability that a current client, who has already been granted a loan, will default over a period of 31-120 days (from now on we will refer to it as PD). Understanding the PD is crucial for LC to proactively manage potential losses and take measures to mitigate them.
%RECOVERIES

For clients in default, we are also interested in providing a model to predict the expected amount of money recovered. This allows us to assess the overall credit risk associated with LC's loan portfolio and encourages measures to mitigate potential losses. Accurately predicting recoveries highlights the importance of estimating future cash flows, ensuring financial solidity for all stakeholders.
%FED

Additionally, when a new client applies for a loan, it is crucial for LC to decide the appropriate interest rate to apply. To achieve this, we aim to forecast the Federal Reserve Bank (FED) interest rate for the upcoming months, which is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it impacts both debtors and investors behaviour influencing borrowing trends and it also directly affects our institution's borrowing costs, guiding our loan interest rate decisions in order to maintain profitability. Lastly, FED rates are linked to broader economic factors like inflation, employment, and economic growth, aiding informed decision-making aligned with macroeconomic conditions.
